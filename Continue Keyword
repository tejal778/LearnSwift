// When iterating through a sequence, we might not need to use every single value.
// If we wanted to only print out all the characters except for vowels ("a", "e", "i", "o", "u") in a String:

let challenge = "bring it"

for char in challenge {
  switch char {
    case "a", "e", "i", "o", "u":
      continue
    default:
      print(char)
  }
}
// We have a switch statement which checks char and if it is any of the following characters: "a", "e", "i", "o", and "u". Inside our case statement, if the character matches, we skip over it with continue. If our character is not a vowel, then we print it out.

// Output
b
r
n
g

t

//Example
// Currently, in our for-in loop we print out every single number in the range, 1...9. However, we donâ€™t want to print out the odd numbers.
// Inside the for-in loop, add the code needed to skip over the odd numbers by adding:
// An if statement that checks if num is an odd number.
// Inside the body of the if statement, the continue keyword.

for num in 1...9 {
  // Add your code below ðŸ”¢ 
  if num % 2 == 1 {
    continue
  }
  
  
  print(num)
}

print("Who do we appreciate?")
print("YOU!")

//Output
2
4
6
8
Who do we appreciate?
YOU!
