We can use .insert() to add elements to a set using this syntax:

// setName.insert(NewValue)

When appending elements to a set:

// The set we are adding to must already exist.
// The new value must be the same data type that the set was initialized with.
// If we try to add an item that already exists, the item will still only appear once in the set.

EXAMPLE :

var plantShelf: Set = ["Haworthia", "Corpuscularia", "Echeveria"]
plantShelf.insert("Graptopetalum")

//OUTPUT
["Haworthia", "Graptopetalum", "Echeveria", "Corpuscularia"]

//Example:
var friends: Set = ["Harry", "Ron"]
print("There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and defeating a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.")

// Add your code below âœ¨
friends.insert("Hermione")
friends.insert("Ron")


print("Friends: \(friends)")

//OUTPUT
There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and defeating a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.
Friends: ["Harry", "Hermione", "Ron"]
