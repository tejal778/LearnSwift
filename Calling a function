The process of executing the code inside the body of a function is known as calling it. 
To call a function in Swift, type out its name followed by parentheses ().

EXAMPLE:

func makeSushiRoll() {
 print("First, spread rice on Nori")
 print("Next, add fillings")
 print("Carefully roll the sushi")
 print("Cut the sushi")
 print("Serve 🍣") 
} 

Explanation:

To call our function, we must type out the function’s name followed by a pair of parenthesis: makeSushiRoll()

Calling the function will execute the print() statements within the body and result in the following output:
First, spread rice on Nori
Next, add fillings
Carefully roll the sushi
Cut the sushi
Serve 🍣

EXAMPLE:

func mySpecialRecipe() -> Void {
  print("Boil, mix flavour, stir, serve")
}

mySpecialRecipe()

Output -> Boil, mix flavour, stir, serve
