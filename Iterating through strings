// Letâ€™s say we wanted to look over a string and see if it contains "z". In a program, that means we would loop through the characters of a String. In each iteration would we check if the character was a "z".

var quote = "our whole life is solving puzzles."

for character in quote {
  print(character)
  if character == "z" {
    print("There's a z!")
  }
