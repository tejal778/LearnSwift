A dictionary with no key-value pairs is also known as an empty dictionary.

This option is useful when we want to populate our dictionary at a later time.

SYNTAX :

We can create an empty dictionary using empty dictionary literal syntax like this:

var dictionaryName: [KeyType: ValueType] = [:]

1. We need to declare the data type of the keys and the values.
2. After the assignment operator =, we use [:] to declare it’s an empty dictionary.

                            OR

var dictionaryName = [KeyType: ValueType]()

1. We declare the key and value type after the assignment operator.
2. We add parentheses () after declaring the data types.


/// EXAMPLE
Let’s create an empty dictionary called yearlyPopulation that contains Int type keys and Int type values.

Empty dictionary literal syntax:

var yearlyPopulation: [Int: Int] = [:]

Initializer syntax:

var yearlyPopulation = [Int: Int]()

// Example //

var emptyLiteral: [String: Int] = [:]     //DICTIONARY LITERAL SYNTAX
var emptyInitializer = [String: Bool]()   //Initializer Syntax
