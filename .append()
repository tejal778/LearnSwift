We can add a new item to the end of an array by calling the array’s .append() method:

name.append(value)

For example, suppose we have an array called gymBadges:

var gymBadges = ["Boulder", "Cascade"]

We can add a new item, "Thunder", to the end of the array by:

gymBadges.append("Thunder") 

// ["Boulder", "Cascade", "Thunder"]

Alternatively, append an array of one or more items with the addition assignment operator +=:

gymBadges += ["Thunder", "Rainbow"]

// ["Boulder", "Cascade", "Thunder", "Rainbow"]



var resolutions = ["play more music 🎸",
                   "read more books 📚",
                   "drink more water 💧"]

// Write your code below 💪

resolutions.append("Get fit")
resolutions += ["Lose weight"]

print(resolutions)                                 // ["play more music 🎸", "read more books 📚", "drink more water 💧", "Get fit", "Lose weight"]
