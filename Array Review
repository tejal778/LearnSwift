An array is a list of ordered items.
var evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

The first index in an array is 0.
The .count property that returns the size of an array.
Some of the methods that come with arrays:
.append(): adding an item to the end
.insert(): adding an item to an index
.remove(): removing an item from an index
The for-in loop can be used to iterate through an array.

// Write a Swift program to find the sum of even numbers and the product of odd numbers in an array.
//For example, suppose we have an array that is [2, 4, 3, 6, 1, 9], then the program should output:
Sum of even numbers is 12
Product of odd numbers is 27

//Code

var list = [2, 4, 3, 6, 1, 9]
var sum = 0
var num = 0
// Write your code below ðŸ§®
for item in list {
  if item%2 == 0 {
    sum += item
  } 
  if item%2 == 1 {
    num += item
  }
}
print("Sum of even numbers is \(sum)")
print("Sum of odd numbers is \(num)")


//Output
Sum of even numbers is 12
Sum of odd numbers is 13
