To iterate over every item of a set, we can use this syntax:

for Value in setName {
  // Body of loop
}

//EXAMPLE
Letâ€™s create a set that stores the necessary ingredients for baking chocolate chip cookies:

//CODE

var chocoChipCookies: Set = ["Flour", "Chocolate Chips", "Butter", "Eggs", "Sugar", "Baking Powder"]

for ingredient in chocoChipCookies {                      //We can use a for-in loop that will print() all the ingredients we need
  print(ingredient)
}

//OUTPUT
Flour
Chocolate Chips
Eggs
Baking Powder
Butter
Sugar

//EXAMPLE
var thingsToPack: Set = ["Bathing Suit", "Clothes", "Sunglasses", "Sunscreen", "Favorite Book", "Phone Charger"]

var suitcase = Set<String>()

// Add your code below ðŸŒ´
for item in thingsToPack {
  
  suitcase.insert(item)
}

print(suitcase)

//OUTPUT
["Sunglasses", "Bathing Suit", "Sunscreen", "Phone Charger", "Favorite Book", "Clothes"]
