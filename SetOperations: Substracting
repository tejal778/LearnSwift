.subtracting(). This method creates a new set of elements by removing the overlapping data of one set from another set.

To use .subtracting() in our program, we can use this code:

var newSet = SetA.subtracting(SetB)
Any values that SetA shares with SetB will be removed and newSet will contain values found only in SetA but not in SetB.

//EXAMPLE
Consider the following sets: animals and notEndangered:

var animals: Set = ["Bison", "Mountain Gorilla", "Hedgehog", "Sea Turtle", "Vaquita", "Ocelot"]
var notEndangered: Set = ["Bison", "Hedgehog", "Ocelot"]

var endangered = animals.subtracting(notEndangered)      //We can use .subtracting() to create a set of animals that are endangered based on the two sets above

//OUTPUT
["Vaquita", "Mountain Gorilla", "Sea Turtle"]

//EXAMPLE
var foodEmojis: Set = ["🥕", "🍇", "🌶️", "🍒", "🍎", "🥦"]
var fruitEmojis: Set = ["🍇", "🍎", "🍒"]

// Add your code below 🥗

var veggieEmojis = foodEmojis.subtracting(fruitEmojis)

print(veggieEmojis)

//OUTPUT
["🥕", "🥦", "🌶️"]
