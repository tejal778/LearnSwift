The .symmetricDifference() operation can be used to find elements that exist in one of the given sets, but not both.

The syntax for creating a set using .symmetricDifference() looks like this:

var NewSet = SetA.symmetricDifference(SetB)

//EXAMPLE
The following sets nintendoSwitch and playStation4 store String values of games that can be played on that specific console:

var nintendoSwitch: Set = ["Animal Crossing", "DOOM Eternal", "Stardew Valley"]

var playStation4: Set = ["DOOM Eternal", "Stardew Valley", "The Last of Us"]

To find which games are exclusive to only one console, we can use .symmetricDifference() to remove any values that appear in both switchConsole and playStation4:

var exclusiveGames = nintendoSwitch.symmetricDifference(playStation4)

//OUTPUT
["Animal Crossing", "The Last of Us"]

//Example
var oscarWinners: Set = ["Heath Ledger", "Rita Moreno", "Audrey Hepburn", "John Legend"]
var emmyWinners: Set = ["Peter Dinklage", "John Legend", "Audrey Hepburn", "Rita Moreno"]

// Add your code below üèÜ
var difference = oscarWinners.symmetricDifference(emmyWinners)

print(difference)

//OUTPUT
["Peter Dinklage", "Heath Ledger"]
