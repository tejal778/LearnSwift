If you have ever been stuck in a car during a long drive, you might have sung some fun, repetitive songs to help pass the time. One of those songs may have been the “99 Bottles of Milk” song.
The first verse of this song goes like this:
“99 bottles of milk on the wall, 99 bottles of milk!
You take one down and pass it around…
98 bottles of milk on the wall!”
The following verse repeats the lyrics above, except this time it would start with 98 bottles and end with 97 bottles; then, the lyrics would continue to repeat over and over again until we are left with 0 bottles of milk. When you think about it, that’s a lot of repetition!
Write a program in Bottles.swift that uses a while loop to print the “99 Bottles of Milk” song in its entirety.

//Code

var numBottles: Int = 99
while numBottles > 0 {

print ("\(numBottles) bottles of milk on the wall, \(numBottles) bottles of milk!")
print ("You take one down and pass it around...")

numBottles = numBottles - 1

print ("\(numBottles) bottles of milk on the wall!")

}

print ("0 bottles of milk on the wall, 0 bottles of milk!Go to the store and buy some more,99 bottles of milk on the wall!")
