We can use the following syntax to check for an element inside of a set:

setName.contains(Value)
If the item exists within the set, the expression returns true.
If the item does not appear in the set, the expression returns false.
Imagine we are hosting a party. Let‚Äôs create a set for all the food we currently have in the house:

var foodAtHome: Set = ["Chips", "Guacamole", "Cookies", "Pizza Bagels"]

We are about to head to the store and want to check if we already have "Salsa" at home or if we need to buy more.

We can use the following if/else statement with foodAtHome.contains("Salsa") as our conditional:

if foodAtHome.contains("Salsa") {
  print("We don't need any more salsa.")
} else {
  print("Let's buy more salsa.")
}

// Prints: Let's buy more salsa.


var coffeeFlavors: Set = ["Caramel", "Mocha", "Pumpkin Spice", "Vanilla", "Blueberry"]

// Write your code below üçµ

if coffeeFlavors.contains("Blueberry") {
  print ("One blueberry coffee coming right up.")
}
else {
  print ("We do not serve that coffee flavor here.")
}

//OUTPUT
One blueberry coffee coming right up.
