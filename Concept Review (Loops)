for-in loops are used to iterate over collection items like ranges and strings.
stride() creates a range that we can customize.
_ usage when we don’t need to use the placeholder variable.
continue allows us to move on to the next value.
break stops the loop before the stopping condition is met.
while loops are used when we don’t know how many times we’re looping.
