A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.

There are many similarities between sets and arrays, but the main differences between the two are:

Set elements cannot be repeated, while that is allowed in arrays.
A set does not have a defined order, while an array does.

Creating empty set:
var setName = Set<Type>()

//
To initialize a set, use the Set keyword followed by the data type of the elements it will contain.
To signify we are creating an empty set, add parentheses () at the end of the statement.
\\

Example:
var instruments = Set<String>()

// To create a populated set:
var setName: Set = [Value1, Value2, Value3]

// 
We must use the Set keyword.
All values must be contained within brackets [] and each value is separated by a comma ,.
There are no repeated values.
The elements of the set must all be the same type.
\\

//If we wanted to create a set that stores members of the Swift team, our code would look like this:

var swiftTeam: Set = ["Galina", "Kenny", "Sonny", "Alex"]

EXAMPLE:
var consonants = Set<Character>()
var vowels: Set = ["A", "E", "I", "O", "U"]
print(vowels)

// Output
["E", "I", "O", "U", "A"]   // Can be random
