Our goal is to take human phrases like "turpentine and turtles" and translate it to its “whale talk” equivalent: "UUEEIEEAUUEE".
There are a few simple rules for translating English text to “whale language”:
There are no consonants. Only vowels: "a", "e", "i", "o", "u".
The "u"s and "e"s are extra long, so we must double them in our program.
Once we have converted text to the whale language, the result is sung slowly, as is a custom in the ocean.
Write a WhaleTalk.swift program that uses loops to accomplish this translation.

//Code
var input = "Lets go drink beer at mussorie in the night"
var output = ""
for char in input {
  let lowerChar = char.lowercased()

switch lowerChar {
  case "a", "i", "o":
  output = output + lowerChar.uppercased()
  case "e":
  output += "ee"
  case "u":
  output += "UU"
  default:
  break
}
}

print (output)

//Output
eeOIeeeeAUUOIeeIeeI

//Additional 
Add an additional case to the switch statement.
Allow certain consonants to be included in output.
Combine the "e" and "u" cases into a single compound case.

//Code
var input = "Lets go drink beer at mussorie in the night"
var output = ""
for char in input {
  let lowerChar = char.lowercased()

switch lowerChar {
  case "a", "i", "o":
  output = output + lowerChar.uppercased()
  case "e":
  output += "ee"
  case "u":
  output += "UU"
  case "b", "c", "r":
  output += "eeUU"
  default:
  break
}
}

print (output)

//Output
eeOeeUUIeeUUeeeeeeUUAUUOeeUUIeeIeeI
