// We can use the break keyword to exit out of the loop before the loop fully completes:

let respect = 556

for pageNum in 1...1000 {
  if pageNum == respect {
    print("Respect means: to admire someone for their abilities.")
    break
  }
  print("On page \(pageNum) and still no 'respect'!")
}

//Output
On page 1 and still no 'respect'!
On page 2 and still no 'respect'!
...
On page 555 and still no 'respect'!
Respect means: to admire someone for their abilities.

//Example
// To complete the program, in the for-in loop:
// Add an if statement that checks if counter is equal to guessedNum.
// Inside the if body, print out the "It's [guessedNum]!!" and replace [guessedNum] with the actual value of guessedNum.
// After the print() statement, add a break keyword.
// After you pass this step, run the program a few times to get a sense of when break is exiting the loop.

var guessedNum = Int.random(in: 1...15)

for counter in 1...15 {
  // Add your code below ðŸ¤”
  if counter == guessedNum {
    print ("It's \(guessedNum)!!")
    break
  }
  
  print("Is it \(counter)?")
}

//Output (Break point will keep changing every time 
Is it 1?
Is it 2?
Is it 3?
Is it 4?
It's 5!!
